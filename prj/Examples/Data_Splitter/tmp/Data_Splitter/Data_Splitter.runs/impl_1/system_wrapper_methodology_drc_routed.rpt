TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and adc_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks adc_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and adc_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks adc_clk]

There is a large setup violation of -2.649 ns between system_i/bessel_filter_1/inst/y3/CLK (clocked by adc_clk) and system_i/bessel_filter_1/inst/y1/A[19] (clocked by adc_clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
